ARTIST OPEN CALL QUESTIONS

What research area are you particularly interested in and why?
We are interested in helping audience use artificial intelligence to explore languages, especially as it relates to gender bias. Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
tools such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) -2 and -3 trained on the English language, where "he" is 50% more common than "she," have learned and 
reflected society's biases. But we can "dissect" AI's brains and determine what is making GPT-3 assume a person is male or female. Because GPT-3 relies on 
attention, it is relatively easy to explain why the NLP tool chooses male or female words. http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/ If possible, we can
extend to biases in attentional image analysis tools, such as Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training. https://openai.com/blog/clip/ Our goal would be to 
build on work by NLP experts, often directed toward other experts, to allow general audiences to explore gender bias in GPT-3.

What experience do you have in collaborating?
We have experience collaborating in academia and hackathons. Aaron is earning a Masters of Science in Business Analytics, where every course includes a large group 
component. He also competes in several hackathons with teammates, including a second-place finish in hackthemachine.ai

Would you be open to collaborating with and/or partnering with other artists?
Yes. We would love to get other's inputs to make the project as accessible to as broad an audience as possible, and to make it compelling and captivating.

Tell us why you think you would be a good fit for this project?
I have spent much of professional experience (and my current academic program) explaining
